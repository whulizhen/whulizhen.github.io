The model parameters are chosen carefully, considering the trade-offs between model accuracy and the correlation between parameters. We fit the proposed model to a physics-based SRP model from University College London that is computed using ray-tracing techniques and analyze the properties of the fit. In addition, the accelerations for ECOM-1, ECOM-2 and DREMT are reconstructed from their parameters and compared. The results show that DREMT can capture the main characteristics of SRP better than ECOM-1 and ECOM-2 do, especially when the satellite has a lower sun elevation above orbital plane but is not in eclipse. The reconstructed orbit from different analysis centers shows that DREMT can reduce the mean and standard deviation of SLR residuals by 22% and 25%, respectively compared with ECOM-2. Comparisons between DREMT, ECOM-1, and ECOM-2 show that the DREMT has much better performance in orbit prediction than ECOM-1 and ECOM-2 outside of eclipse seasons. With DREMT, the orbit contribution to the Signal In Space Ranging Error (SISRE) is around 48 cm for both the Galileo In Orbit Validation (IOV) and Full Operation Capacity (FOC) satellites over 7-days prediction, which represents 50% improvement compared with ECOM-1 and ECOM-2.","tags":null,"title":"DREMT: A new physics-based empirical representation of solar radiation pressure for Galileo satellites","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhen Li**","Marek Ziebart"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1575158400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1575158400,"objectID":"b78014d2dc0653098e8b3f74d1f0c395","permalink":"https://whulizhen.github.io/publication/article-9/","publishdate":"2019-12-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article-9/","section":"publication","summary":"Solar radiation pressure is one of the main perturbations that needs to be carefully considered for space missions requiring great precision in satellite’s orbit. The computation of solar radiation pressure is related to both satellite’s geometry and surface material. Solar radiation pressure model is usually used in the estimation of satellite’s position in space. However, the quality of solar radiation pressure model is not assessed in a straightforward way. In this study, we proposed an uncertainty analysis on the satellite’s geometry and the surface optical properties using GPS IIR and Galileo FOC spacecraft. We compared the solar radiation pressure between simple box-wing and the detailed geometry model under the condition that the optical properties are set exactly the same. It showed that the average difference in solar radiation pressure caused by satellite geometry is around 6 nm.s^(-2) and 2 nm.s^(-2) for GPS IIR and Galileo FOC satellite. We also found that the irregular shape of satellite can be a source of the so-called “y-bias” in orbit modelling. In addition, the partial derivatives of solar radiation pressure with respect to optical properties for complex satellite geometry are computed using ray tracing. The solar panels are 10 times more sensitive than the satellite bus in solar radiation pressure computation. Furthermore, solar radiation pressure is about 10 times more sensitive to reflectivity than specularity for both solar panels and satellite bus. If we require the standard deviation of SRP be less than 0.1 nm.s^(-2), the standard deviation of optical properties has to be less than 0.001 on solar panels and 0.01 on satellite bus.","tags":null,"title":"Uncertainty analysis on direct solar radiation pressure modelling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Santosh Bhattarai","Marek Ziebart","S.

Galileo as the European GNSS is now under construction and will be fully operational in 2020. Orbit prediction error is a significant component of the error budget of broadcast ephemeris of Galileo satellites. In short, orbit prediction is intrinsically linked to broadcast ephemeris quality. The quality of orbit prediction relies on accurate force models and initial state (position and velocity). The initial state is usually obtained from precise orbit determination. This research focuses on aspects of force modelling. For the Galileo satellites, the largest force not well modelled is radiation pressure. Using the physics of radiation pressure as an entry point, this thesis is organised according to the technical elements (radiation flux, interaction between radiation flux and surfaces) of radiation pressure modelling. In terms of radiation flux modelling, a runtime and accuracy configurable Earth radiation flux model is developed based on the longwave and shortwave Earth flux observations from Clouds and Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), a shadow function that considers both the Earth's oblateness and atmospheric effect is developed to scale the solar radiation flux at a satellite's location when the satellite is in eclipse. In terms of the interaction between radiation flux and satellite's surfaces, a fast ray tracing algorithm is implemented and gets a speedup by a factor of 30--50 compared with the classical modelling method. In addition, an empirical solar radiation pressure model (the DREMT) is developed based on box-wing satellite model to cope with the un-modelled residuals of physical models. Finally, both the physical models and empirical models are validated in the orbit prediction test. The orbit contribution of Signal in Space Ranging Error (SISRE) is used as an indicator to assess the quality of a 7-day predicted orbit. The newly developed DREMT improved the orbit by around 50% compared with the widely used empirical models (ECOM-1 and ECOM-2) when satellites are not in eclipse. After applying the physical models as a priori models in orbit prediction, DREMT, EOCM-1, and ECOM-2 get identical prediction performance. The DREMT does not get significant improvements using a priori models because it already contains box-wing satellite information implicitly. It is generally the case that the prediction performance is better in non-eclipse seasons than that in eclipse seasons due to a lack of knowledge regarding satellite attitude in eclipse.","tags":null,"title":"Space vehicle radiation pressure modelling: A demonstration on Galileo satellites in GNSS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhen Li**","Marek Ziebart","Santosh Bhattarai","David Harrison"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1538352000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1538352000,"objectID":"009f29eca6e801c836c592b2c10c04bd","permalink":"https://whulizhen.github.io/publication/article-2/","publishdate":"2018-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article-2/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurate Solar Radiation Pressure (SRP) modelling is critical for correctly describing the dynamics of satellites. A shadow function is a unitless quantity varying between 0 and 1 to scale the solar radiation flux at a satellite’s location during eclipses. Errors in modelling shadow function lead to inaccuracy in SRP that degrades the orbit quality. Shadow function modelling requires solutions to a geometrical problem (Earth’s oblateness) and a physical problem (atmospheric effects). This study presents a new shadow function model (PPM_atm) which uses a perspective projection based approach to solve the geometrical problem rigorously and a linear function to describe the reduction of solar radiation flux due to atmospheric effects. GRACE (Gravity Recovery And Climate Experiment) satellites carry accelerometers that record variations of non-conservative forces, which reveal the variations of shadow function during eclipses. In this study, the PPM_atm is validated using accelerometer observations of the GRACE-A satellite. Test results show that the PPM_atm is closer to the variations in accelerometer observations than the widely used SECM (Spherical Earth Conical Model). Taking the accelerometer observations derived shadow function as the “truth”, the relative error in PPM_atm is - 0.79 % while the SECM 11.07%. The influence of the PPM_atm is also shown in orbit prediction for Galileo satellites. Compared with the SECM, the PPM_atm can reduce the radial orbit error RMS by 5.6 cm over a 7-day prediction. The impacts of the errors in shadow function modelling on the orbit remain to be systematic and should be mitigated in long-term orbit prediction.","tags":null,"title":"A shadow function model based on perspective projection and atmospheric effect for satellites in eclipse","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhen Li**","Marek Ziebart","Santosh Bhattarai","David Harrison","Stuart Grey"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1519862400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519862400,"objectID":"40a4ba13db5f5d4e4071ddba8ea675cc","permalink":"https://whulizhen.github.io/publication/article-1/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article-1/","section":"publication","summary":"Physics based SRP (Solar Radiation Pressure) models using ray tracing methods are powerful tools when modelling the forces on complex real world space vehicles. Currently high resolution (1 mm) ray tracing with secondary intersections is done on high performance computers at UCL (University College London). This study introduces the BVH (Bounding Volume Hierarchy) into the ray tracing approach for physics based SRP modelling and makes it possible to run high resolution analysis on personal computers. The ray tracer is both general and efficient enough to cope with the complex shape of satellites and multiple reflections (three or more, with no upper limit). In this study, the traditional ray tracing technique is introduced in the first place and then the BVH is integrated into the ray tracing. Four aspects of the ray tracer were tested for investigating the performance including runtime, accuracy, the effects of multiple reflections and the effects of pixel array resolution.Test results in runtime on GPS IIR and Galileo IOV (In Orbit Validation) satellites show that the BVH can make the force model computation 30-50 times faster. The ray tracer has an absolute accuracy of several nanonewtons by comparing the test results for spheres and planes with the analytical computations. The multiple reflection effects are investigated both in the intersection number and acceleration on GPS IIR, Galileo IOV and Sentinel-1 spacecraft. Considering the number of intersections, the 3rd reflection can capture 99.12%,99.14%, and 91.34% of the total reflections for GPS IIR, Galileo IOV satellite bus and the Sentinel-1 spacecraft respectively. In terms of the multiple reflection effects on the acceleration, the secondary reflection effect for Galileo IOV satellite and Sentinel-1 can reach 0.2 nm/s2 and 0.4 nm/s2 respectively. The error percentage in the accelerations magnitude results show that the 3rd reflection should be considered in order to make it less than 0.035%. The pixel array resolution tests show that the dimensions of the components have to be considered when choosing the spacing of the pixel in order not to miss some components of the satellite in ray tracing. This paper presents the first systematic and quantitative study of the secondary and higher order intersection effects. It shows conclusively the effect is non-negligible for certain classes of misson.","tags":null,"title":"Fast solar radiation pressure modelling with multiple reflections","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Zhen Li**","Marek Ziebart","Santosh Bhattarai","David Harrison"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1493596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1493596800,"objectID":"01d624b70f9bada134b7f834a557f45d","permalink":"https://whulizhen.github.io/publication/article-3/","publishdate":"2017-05-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/article-3/","section":"publication","summary":"This study shows ERP (Earth Radiation Pressure) is significant for pre- cise orbit determination of BeiDou satellites, systematic error is observable in the orbit products if it is ignored in the orbital dynamics.
